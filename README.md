# PDFQuery LangChain Project

## Overview
This project showcases an innovative application of LangChain and Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a powerful question-answering system backed by Astra DB. It demonstrates the capability to initialize database connections, utilize LangChain for embedding and LLM operations, and efficiently store and query data within a vector store environment.

## Features
- **Database Integration**: Establishes a seamless connection to databases for robust data management.
- **LangChain and LLM Utilization**: Leverages the power of LangChain and LLMs for creating embeddings and facilitating complex language-based operations.
- **Vector Store with Astra DB**: Implements a vector store backed by Astra DB, optimizing the storage and retrieval of large datasets.
- **Automated QA Cycle**: Supports an automated question-answering workflow, showcasing the project's ability to handle real-world language processing tasks.
